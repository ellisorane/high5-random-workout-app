This is my first React app "High 5!". It is a workout app that randomly chooses an excerise from a list of 5 predefined exercises. You can choose to add your name or not. Adding your name will send a score of whatever exercises you complete to a database to be compare with other scores. The top 3 scores for each exercise are displayed on the highscores page. You are also able to control the range for the amount of reps that you can handle.
